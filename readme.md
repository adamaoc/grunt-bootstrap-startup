Grunt Startup Project w/ Bootstrap3
===========

You need to have Node and Grunt installed for this project.

Getting Started
---------------
* Run `npm install` to install all the required node modules.
* Run `grunt default` to set your files setup.
* Run `grunt dev` to start your server and see they base site!
    + This will be running at [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) by default.

Editing Files
-------------
### HTML files ###
HTML files are created by combining .hbs files into html.

* go to the `src` folder and under the `layouts` folder is your layout.hbs template.
* edit files withing this `src` file to get your markup.

### CSS files ###
CSS files are created by combining sass files into css.

* Go to the `scss` folder. Use the `style.scss` file to import all your files into.
* Add custom css under the `modules` folder and import those files into your `style.scss` file.

### Live Reload ###
Search for a live reload plugin for your browser. Note I have only tested this within a Chrome browser. Once the plugin is installed all you have to do is enable it while your `grunt dev` is running and your CSS and HTML changes will be updated automatically.

### Don't want Bootstrap or the Stickyfooter theme? ###
Easy enough. Just remove the included files and setup your own layout with CSS.

### Want to contribute? ###
I'm no Node or Grunt expert. I've thrown this together for a quick starting place for my own projects. If you want to help make it better, feel free to fork me and send in pull requests!
